## Motivation

As a competitive GamePigeon player, I love tracking scores with my friends to determine the **ultimate GamePigeon champ** ðŸ‘‘. Initially, I used the iMessage conversation to keep track, but scores got lost, and the search bar wasn't helpful.

</p>

Creating a Notes page was an option to keep track of multiple scoreboards but it was too cumbersome to add a new row each time. I wanted a user-friendly solution to track scores and share scoreboards with my friends effortlessly, but I am too broke to afford a MacBook to make an iOS app. So, I turned to `Shortcuts` to make my dream come true!

## How It Works

**GamePigeon Scoreboard Tracker** lets you create, view, and manage scoreboards with friends in a single, convenient menu. _And here's the cool part_: all your scoreboard data is **private to you**! It's stored on your iCloud Drive, not hosted anywhere where I or anyone else can see it (_unless you share it with someone_).

### Menu

-   **Create**: Start a new scoreboard with a friend and set unique nicknames.
    -   Only one scoreboard per friend is allowed.
-   **View**: Check current scores and game history with your friend.
    -   Game history is displayed in your timezone.
    -   Sort the history table by tapping on the `Date` header.
-   **Update**: Add a new game record to a scoreboard.
    -   Records who won, at which game, and when you updated the scoreboard.
    -   **NOTE**: You cannot delete records off a scoreboard.
-   **Invite**: Invite your friend to view and update the scoreboard.
    -   **Must watch** demo video in the [Demo](#demo) section to know how to invite your friend.
-   **Join**: Accept your friend's invitation to join their scoreboard!
    -   **Must watch** demo video in the [Demo](#demo) section to know how to join a scoreboard.
-   **Reset**: Reset a scoreboard.
-   **Delete**: Delete a scoreboard.
-   **Settings**
    -   **Get My ID**: Copy your unique ID to the clipboard.
        -   Needed when you are invited to join a scoreboard.
    -   **Documentation**: Navigate to this page.
    -   **Change Nicknames**: Change your or your friend's nickname on the scoreboard.
    -   **Update Contact**: Refresh contact info after changes in the `Contacts` app.
        -   Ensures profiles and images are displayed correctly.
        -   Must have up-to-date contact info on file **before inviting** your friend to the scoreboard.
    -   **Download**: Download a zip file of a scoreboard's files (`nicknames.json`, `scores.json`, `history.csv`) to your `Downloads` folder in iCloud Drive.

### Notes

1. Ensure there's enough space on your iCloud Drive for scoreboard files.
2. The shortcut needs several permissions for each scoreboard option. Once you tap **Always Allow** for each permission, you won't be prompted again.
3. If you invite a friend to join the scoreboard, designate one person as the **"recorder."** This prevents accidentally recording the same game when updating the scoreboard since there is no way to delete game records.
