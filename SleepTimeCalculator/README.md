## How It Works

**Sleep Time Calculator** simplifies bedtime and wake-up time decisions with four functions:

-   **Wake up at...**
    -   Enter your desired wake-up time, and the calculator suggests 4 bedtimes, each with varying sleep durations (from 4.5 to 9 hours).
        -   Optionally, set an alarm for your wake-up time.
-   **Fall asleep by...**
    -   Enter your desired bedtime, and the calculator suggests 4 wake-up times, each with varying sleep durations (from 4.5 to 9 hours).
    -   Optionally, set an alarm for one of the suggested wake-up times.
-   **Nap for...**
    -   Enter your desired nap time, and the calculator will set a nap timer.
-   **Sleep now!**
    -   For an immediate bedtime, the calculator suggests 6 wake-up times, each with varying sleep durations (from 1.5 to 9 hours).
    -   Optionally, set an alarm for one of the suggested wake-up times.

### Notes

-   To prevent clutter in the `Clock` app, any previously set alarms through this shortcut will be prompted to be deleted when you set a new alarm through this shortcut again.
    -   ðŸ’¡Tip: For automatic deletion, enable **Allow Deleting Without Confirmation** in your deviceâ€™s settings (_Settings > Shortcuts > Advanced_).
-   The Sleep Time Calculator provides recommendations based on sleep cycles. The average adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep, but alternatives are offered for situations with less time. Individual sleep needs vary; consult a healthcare professional for persistent sleep issues.

### The Science

The Sleep Time Calculator applies scientific principles related to sleep cycles and duration for optimal bedtimes and wake-up times. The sleep cycle is divided into several stages: light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sleep cycles typically last around 90 minutes, and a typical night's sleep consists of several cycles. The goal of the calculator is to suggest times to wake up at the end of a cycle feeling refreshed, rather groggy.
