## How It Works

**Quickcord** simplifies sending _**any**_ content to a specific Discord channel directly from `Share Sheet` or `Clipboard`, eliminating the need to open the app or use the Discord app's `Share Sheet`.

### Notes

-   Ensure you are the owner or have mod privileges, on the server the channel is located, to access server settings.
-   For sending multiple items, enable **Allow Sharing Large Amounts of Data** in your device's settings (_Settings > Shortcuts > Advanced_).
-   Exceeding max file upload size? Compress files or provide a hyperlink.

## Benefits

-   Copy/paste content from your device to a PC (_non-MacBook users' favorite!_).
-   Bypass Discord's auto-conversion/compression for images/videos.
-   Store text & files for future reference.
-   Send code blocks with syntax highlighting.
-   Integrate with automations!
    -   Send memes regularly, using the **Time of Day** automation.
    -   Let your friends know you're getting big at the gym, using the **Arrive** automation.
    -   Forward messages from iMessage, using the **Message** automation.

## Prerequisites

A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: On Your PC

1. Navigate to **Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**.
2. Click **New Webhook**.
3. Select the channel and customize the webhook.
4. Click **Copy Webhook URL** and send the webhook URL to your device.

### Step 2: On Your Device

1. Download this shortcut and follow the setup (_refer to [Settings](#settings) for details_).
2. Tap **Done**.

## Settings

Configure the following settings to your preferences.

1. **Webhook URL**: Direct link for content upload (_refer to [Getting Started](#getting-started) for details_).
2. **Character Limit**: Max # of characters per message.
    - Default: **2000**
    - Discord Nitro: **4000**
    - If the character limit is exceeded, it's uploaded as a **.txt** file instead.
3. **Max File Size**: Max file size (_in MB_) per message.
    - Default: **25**
    - Discord Nitro Basic: **50** | Discord Nitro: **500**
4. **Preserve Images**: Preserve image format and metadata.
    - Default: **False**
        - Images are converted to **.jpeg** and metadata is removed.
        - To guarantee images are embeddable on Discord, leave this setting on default.
5. **Preserve Videos**: Preserve video format and metadata.
    - Default: **False**
        - Videos are re-encoded to **H.264** and metadata is removed. Videos smaller than 4K will not be downscaled.
        - To guarantee videos are embeddable on Discord, leave this setting on default.
            - _Except not all video extensions are not embeddable on Discord: [Source #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/f2kt5r/guide_file_formats_discord_can_embed/) & [Source #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/rtbv2g/embedded_videos_formats_list/)_
6. **Send Text As Code**: Send text as a code block, with syntax highlighting.
    - Default: **False**

### Change Settings

Follow these steps to change the above settings at any time.

1. Edit the shortcut (_by tapping the three dots in the upper right_).
2. Scroll down to the **Settings** section.
3. Adjust values in the _Dictionary_ object.

### Transfer Settings

Settings won't automatically transfer to new versions. You must copy and paste them manually.

1.  Edit the old shortcut, go to the **Settings** section, and copy the necessary value(s).
2.  Edit the new shortcut, go to the **Settings** section, and paste the value(s).
