## How It Works

**Frames Splitter** takes any valid media (_i.e. live photos, videos_) from your `Photos` library or `Share Sheet`, splits the media into every single frame using _ffmpeg_, and saves each frame as a JPEG in your `Files` app.

You can change the framerate of your media to reduce the number of frames as output.
