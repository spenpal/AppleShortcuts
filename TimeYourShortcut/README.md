## How It Works

**Time Your Shortcut** calculates the total run time of any shortcut in seconds, with millisecond precision. You can also test specific sections of your shortcut (_refer to [Getting Started](#getting-started) for details_).

### Notes

-   Run this shortcut against your tested shortcut **at least twice**. This is because permissions may be asked by the `Shortcuts` app for the first run.
-   If your tested shortcut involves user interaction, be aware that it contributes to the total run time.

## Getting Started

### Test Your Shortcut

1. Edit this shortcut (_by tapping the three dots in the upper right_).
2. Navigate to the **MAIN CODE** section, where you'll find a **Run Shortcut** action. Select the shortcut you want to test.
3. Exit edit mode and run it!

## Auto-Updater

This shortcut utilizes the [UpdateKit API](https://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit-api/v1) for seamless updates.

-   Checks periodically for updates.
-   Retrieves your device's version to check compatibility.
    -   _If your device is incompatible with the shortcut, updates won't be presented_.
-   Won't check for updates, if you are offline.
    -   _It verifies your device's IP address to determine connection status_.
-   When an update is available, choose **Install** or **Skip**.

## Privacy

-   No sensitive/identifying information is requested âœ….
    -   _However, reviewing the shortcut's actions is your responsibility_.
-   If permissions are required, tap **Always Allow**.
    -   _You can manage these permissions in the shortcut's privacy settings_.
