## How It Works

**Wallpaper Roulette** fetches a random wallpaper from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), sizing it to your device's resolution for both the lock and home screens.

If you have a specific wallpaper preference, input a keyword for a guided search. Keep in mind, it's a wallpaper **finder**, not a _generator_ - embracing the spirit of randomness!

Also, if you're particularly fond of the current wallpaper, you can save it to your `Photos` app.
